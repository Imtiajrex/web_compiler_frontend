# NCC Compiler made using webassembly

[NCC compiler](https://github.com/Raihan-28011/ncc) c++ version repository is coded by [Raihan](https://github.com/Raihan-28011)

I have compiled the ncc c++ version into webassembly with emscripten and used react to run code from browser directly

**You can use ncc web here.... [Webpiler](https://webpiler.netlify.app/)**

and voila it compiled with ncc compiler!

## Some bugs/errors

- This is not mobile responsive yet!
- Compiling may sometimes freeze website ui
- Sometimes print() function may not work without '\n' character.
